Background: 
-
Imagine you are a data analyst working for a tech company that specializes in developing mobile applications. Your company has recently acquired a dataset from the Google Play Store, which contains information about various apps, including their ratings, reviews, sizes,
and more. The company is keen to analyze this data to gain insights that can help improve their app development strategies, enhance user experience, and increase app downloads and revenues.


Problem Statement:
-
Your task is to analyze this dataset to uncover patterns and trends that can guide the company's decision-making process. The analysis should focus on understanding what factors contribute to high app ratings, identifying the most popular app categories, and exploring the impact of 
app size and price on user reviews and installs.

Stakeholders:
-
Internal Stakeholders:
● App Developers
● Product Managers
● Marketing Team
● Senior Management

External Stakeholders:
● App Users
● Advertisers
● Partners (e.g., other tech companies or platforms)

Data Requirements:
-
The data provided includes the following columns:
● App: Name of the app
● Category: Category of the app
● Rating: Average user rating of the app
● Reviews: Number of user reviews
● Size: Size of the app
● Installs: Number of installs
● Type: Whether the app is free or paid
● Price: Price of the app
● Content Rating: Age group for which the app is appropriate
● Genres: Genres of the app
● Last Updated: Date when the app was last updated
● Current Ver: Current version of the app
● Android Ver: Minimum Android version required

Conclusion
-
This project involved analyzing various aspects of mobile applications, including app size distribution, free vs paid apps, update frequency, and sentiment analysis of reviews.
-The majority of apps have a size within a certain range (e.g., 10MB - 100MB), with a few larger apps exceeding 500MB.
-Small apps (< 50MB) are commonly utility-based, lightweight apps, while larger apps (100MB+) are typically gaming, multimedia, or feature-rich applications.
-The dataset showed a significant dominance of free apps over paid ones.
-Paid apps represented a small percentage of the total, indicating that most developers rely on alternative revenue models like in-app purchases or ads.
-A histogram or line plot of update frequency showed that most active apps tend to receive updates every 1-3 months, while less frequently updated apps may go 6+ months without changes.
-The sentiment analysis categorized reviews into Positive, Negative, and Neutral groups using NLP techniques.
